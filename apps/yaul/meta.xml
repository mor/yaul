	<short_description>Yet Another USB Loader</short_description>
	<long_description>'yaul' lets you backup your game disks to a USB device. It also presents a menu of all your backed up games so you can launch them off the drive. It's based on Waninkoko's sd-usb-loader, and also uses snippets from other open source Wii software.  Thanks to all the fabulously talented and generous programmers working on Wii Homebrew!</long_description>
