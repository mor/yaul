[+] yaul - Yet Another USB Loader
    Produced by xmor61, forked from Waninkoko's SD/USB Loader
    July 30, 2009


[+] What _exactly_ is it?

yaul is a program for the Nintendo Wii that lets you backup your game
DVDs to a USB device. It also presents a menu of all your backed up games
so you can launch them off the drive.  Thus you can put your original
disks away to preserve them, and speed up game loading.  yaul is based
on Waninkoko's sd-usb-loader, and also uses snippets from other open
source Wii software (see below).


[+] How do I get it?

yaul is open-source software under the GNU GPL. The latest source and
binary files are available at my github repository, found here:

	http://github.com/mor/yaul/tree/yaul

Or you can get an HBC ready binary package at my homepage, here:

Anyone interested in contributing code to yaul is invited to participate
via the git verstion control system. Instructions are at the github site
linked above.


[+] What do I need to run it?

yaul is homebrew and so, you'll need to install the Homebrew Channel or
figure some other way to run homebrew apps. Click on the links to the left
for more info on Wii hacking.

Your Wii will need cIOS36, rev 10 or higher installed in order to run
yaul. I recommend the latest cIOS from Waninkoko, cIOS38 rev 14, as that's
what I use on my Wii to test yaul with, and it works well for me. You will
need to have devkitPro installed to compile it, in case you're interested.

Of course, you'll also need a hard drive connected to your Wii via the USB
port. yaul will format your drive the first time you plug it in. You
should also have networking configured and working on your Wii if you want
yaul to show you box art on it's menus.
